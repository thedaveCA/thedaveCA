## about:me

I don't know what I'm doing, which is great, there's so much to learn! Can you think of a better place to start?

Digging into C#, it's been a bit of an adventure so far! While I'm not necessarily the n00biest n00b that ever did code, I'm feeling a bit like it. That's okay. Ultimately my goal is to become a passably competent C# developer. I'm starting on my own although I am open to education at some point too, but I'd like to find something in the real world which just isn't how things work in the COVID era. Oh well.

Also a total Github n00b, but hey, I'm using it instead of despising it, so that is a start, I think? I get the point of version control, I love the idea of branches, but something just rubs me the wrong way. On the other hand, it would have saved my butt if I'd been using it a decade ago, so here we go.

## What's next?

Initially I am starting out by re-coding some absolutely *terrible* PHP code that I wrote in the past, various stuff I just slapped together to solve a problem I had, mostly copy/pasted from StackOverflow and others in the finest tradition of PHP.

And looking at some stuff on NuGet, trying to figure out how some libraries work to see if I can interact with some services I already use.

Oh and I might look at a bunch of old batch-type scripts that I could rewrite. Heck, maybe even some Linux shell scripts that I wrote and use regularly could pack up and go away?

Plus I'm looking for any bugs I fixed in code belonging to other projects that didn't get committed, and I'll submit a proper PR. I typically did not do so before simply because I was not confident about my skills, nor was I familiar enough with Github. 

And in fact, I just logged my first issue including a PR to a public project. Woohoo, at least if it gets acceptted.

This is such a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository!
